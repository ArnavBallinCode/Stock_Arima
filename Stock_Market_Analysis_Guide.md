## 🎯 **1. Stock Market Fundamentals**

### **What is a Stock?**
Think of a **stock** as owning a tiny piece of a company. When you buy NVDA (NVIDIA) stock, you literally own a small fraction of NVIDIA Corporation.

### **Why Do Stock Prices Move?**
Stock prices change based on **supply and demand**:
- **More buyers than sellers** → Price goes UP 📈
- **More sellers than buyers** → Price goes DOWN 📉
- **Equal buyers and sellers** → Price stays FLAT ➡️

### **What Affects Stock Prices?**
- **Company Performance**: Earnings, revenue, growth
- **Market Sentiment**: Fear, greed, optimism, pessimism
- **Economic News**: Interest rates, inflation, GDP
- **Industry Trends**: New technology, regulations
- **Global Events**: Wars, pandemics, political changes

### **Basic Trading Concepts:**
- **Bull Market**: Overall rising prices 🐂📈
- **Bear Market**: Overall falling prices 🐻📉
- **Volatility**: How much prices swing up and down
- **Liquidity**: How easily you can buy/sell without affecting price

## 📊 **2. Price Charts & OHLCV Data**

### **The 5 Essential Data Points (OHLCV):**

#### **🔓 Open**: 
- The **first** price when trading starts that day
- Like the "starting price" of a race

#### **🔴 High**: 
- The **highest** price reached during that day
- Shows the maximum optimism/demand

#### **🔵 Low**: 
- The **lowest** price reached during that day  
- Shows the maximum pessimism/selling pressure

#### **🔒 Close**: 
- The **final** price when trading ends that day
- Most important price - shows where the "battle" ended

#### **📦 Volume**: 
- **How many shares** were traded that day
- High volume = lots of interest/activity
- Low volume = little interest/activity

### **📈 Candlestick Charts Explained:**

#### **Green/White Candle** (Bullish 🟢):
```
    │ ← High (top wick)
  ┌─┴─┐
  │   │ ← Body (Open to Close)
  │   │   Close is HIGHER than Open
  └─┬─┘
    │ ← Low (bottom wick)
```

#### **Red/Black Candle** (Bearish 🔴):
```
    │ ← High (top wick)  
  ┌─┴─┐
  │▓▓▓│ ← Body (Open to Close)
  │▓▓▓│   Close is LOWER than Open  
  └─┬─┘
    │ ← Low (bottom wick)
```

### **What Candlesticks Tell Us:**
- **Long body**: Strong price movement (bulls or bears in control)
- **Long wicks**: Price rejected at highs/lows (indecision)
- **Small body**: Indecision between buyers and sellers
- **No wicks**: Strong commitment to the direction

## 🔧 **3. Technical Indicators (The Heart of Our App)**

### **📈 SMA (Simple Moving Average)**

#### **What it is:**
The **average price** over a specific number of days.

#### **Math Formula:**
```
SMA_20 = (Day1 + Day2 + ... + Day20) ÷ 20
```

#### **Example:**
If NVDA closed at: $100, $102, $98, $105, $103 over 5 days
```
SMA_5 = (100 + 102 + 98 + 105 + 103) ÷ 5 = $101.60
```

#### **What it tells us:**
- **Price ABOVE SMA**: Stock is in **uptrend** 📈
- **Price BELOW SMA**: Stock is in **downtrend** 📉  
- **Price TOUCHING SMA**: Potential **support/resistance**

#### **In Our App:**
- **SMA_10**: Short-term trend (10 days)
- **SMA_20**: Medium-term trend (20 days)  
- **SMA_50**: Long-term trend (50 days)

---

### **⚡ EMA (Exponential Moving Average)**

#### **What it is:**
Like SMA but gives **MORE weight** to recent prices.

#### **Math Formula:**
```
EMA = (Price_today × Multiplier) + (EMA_yesterday × (1 - Multiplier))
Multiplier = 2 ÷ (Period + 1)
```

#### **Why it's better than SMA:**
- **Reacts faster** to price changes
- **Less lag** than SMA
- **More sensitive** to recent movements

#### **In Our App:**
- **EMA_12**: Fast moving average
- **EMA_26**: Slow moving average
- Used to calculate **MACD**

---

### **🌊 MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)**

#### **What it is:**
Shows the **relationship** between two EMAs.

#### **Components:**
1. **MACD Line** = EMA_12 - EMA_26
2. **Signal Line** = 9-day EMA of MACD Line  
3. **Histogram** = MACD Line - Signal Line

#### **How to read it:**
- **MACD above Signal**: Bullish momentum 🟢
- **MACD below Signal**: Bearish momentum 🔴
- **MACD crosses above Signal**: BUY signal 🚀
- **MACD crosses below Signal**: SELL signal 📉
- **Histogram growing**: Momentum increasing
- **Histogram shrinking**: Momentum decreasing

#### **Real Example:**
```
If EMA_12 = $105 and EMA_26 = $103
MACD = $105 - $103 = +$2 (Bullish)

If MACD = +$2 and Signal = +$1.5  
Histogram = +$2 - $1.5 = +$0.5 (Growing bullish momentum)
```

---

### **⚖️ RSI (Relative Strength Index)**

#### **What it is:**
Measures if a stock is **overbought** or **oversold**.

#### **Math Formula:**
```
RS = Average Gain ÷ Average Loss (over 14 days)
RSI = 100 - (100 ÷ (1 + RS))
```

#### **RSI Scale (0-100):**
- **RSI > 70**: **OVERBOUGHT** 🔴 (might fall soon)
- **RSI < 30**: **OVERSOLD** 🟢 (might rise soon)  
- **RSI 30-70**: **NORMAL** range
- **RSI = 50**: Neutral (equal buying/selling pressure)

#### **How to use:**
- **RSI hits 80+**: Consider selling (too high)
- **RSI hits 20-**: Consider buying (too low)
- **RSI divergence**: Price goes up but RSI goes down = weakness

---

### **📊 Bollinger Bands**

#### **What they are:**
Three lines that create a "channel" around price.

#### **Components:**
1. **Middle Band** = 20-day SMA
2. **Upper Band** = Middle + (2 × Standard Deviation)
3. **Lower Band** = Middle - (2 × Standard Deviation)

#### **Math:**
```
Standard Deviation = √[(Price - Average)² ÷ Number of days]
Upper Band = SMA_20 + (2 × StdDev)
Lower Band = SMA_20 - (2 × StdDev)
```

#### **What they tell us:**
- **Price near Upper Band**: Stock might be **overbought**
- **Price near Lower Band**: Stock might be **oversold**
- **Bands squeeze together**: **Low volatility** (big move coming)
- **Bands expand**: **High volatility** (big moves happening)

#### **BB_Position in our app:**
```
BB_Position = (Current_Price - Lower_Band) ÷ (Upper_Band - Lower_Band)
```
- **BB_Position = 1.0**: Price at upper band
- **BB_Position = 0.0**: Price at lower band  
- **BB_Position = 0.5**: Price in middle

---

### **📈 Volume Indicators**

#### **Volume_SMA (Volume Simple Moving Average):**
- **Average daily volume** over 20 days
- Shows "normal" trading activity

#### **Volume_Ratio:**
```
Volume_Ratio = Today's_Volume ÷ Volume_SMA
```
- **Ratio > 1.5**: **High volume** (unusual interest)
- **Ratio < 0.5**: **Low volume** (little interest)
- **High volume + price up**: Strong bullish signal
- **High volume + price down**: Strong bearish signal

---

### **💹 Price-Based Indicators**

#### **Daily_Return:**
```
Daily_Return = (Today's_Close - Yesterday's_Close) ÷ Yesterday's_Close
```
- Shows daily percentage change
- **Positive**: Stock went up
- **Negative**: Stock went down

#### **ATR (Average True Range):**
Measures daily **volatility** (how much price moves).
```
True_Range = MAX of:
1. High - Low  
2. |High - Previous_Close|
3. |Low - Previous_Close|

ATR = Average of True_Range over 14 days
```
- **High ATR**: Very volatile (risky but potentially rewarding)
- **Low ATR**: Stable (safer but smaller moves)

---

## 🔍 **4. Data Quality Metrics (What Our App Checks)**

### **📊 Missing Values**
#### **What they are:**
Days where we don't have price data (holidays, system errors, etc.)

#### **Why they matter:**
- **Missing data** can break calculations
- **Gaps** in data create false signals
- Need **complete data** for accurate analysis

#### **How we handle them:**
- **Forward Fill**: Use last known price
- **Backward Fill**: Use next known price  
- **Remove**: Delete incomplete days

---

### **🎯 Outliers** 
#### **What they are:**
Prices that are **extremely different** from normal.

#### **Math (IQR Method):**
```
Q1 = 25th percentile (bottom quarter)
Q3 = 75th percentile (top quarter)  
IQR = Q3 - Q1
Lower_Bound = Q1 - (1.5 × IQR)
Upper_Bound = Q3 + (1.5 × IQR)

Any price outside these bounds = Outlier
```

#### **Example:**
If NVDA normally trades $100-120, but one day it's $200, that's an outlier.

#### **Why they matter:**
- Can be **data errors** (wrong price recorded)
- Can be **real events** (earnings surprise, news)
- **Skew calculations** if not handled properly

---

### **📈 Statistical Summary**
#### **Mean (Average):** 
Sum of all prices ÷ Number of days

#### **Standard Deviation:**
How much prices typically vary from the average
- **Low StdDev**: Stable stock
- **High StdDev**: Volatile stock

#### **Min/Max:**
- **Lowest price** in the period
- **Highest price** in the period  
- Shows the **trading range**

#### **Percentiles:**
- **25%**: Price that 25% of days were below
- **50%**: Median price (middle value)
- **75%**: Price that 75% of days were below

## 🔮 **5. ARIMA Analysis (Advanced Forecasting)**

### **What is ARIMA?**
**AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average** - a mathematical model that predicts future prices based on past patterns.

### **The Three Components:**

#### **🔄 AR (AutoRegressive):**
Uses **past prices** to predict future prices.
```
Price_today = a₁×Price_yesterday + a₂×Price_2days_ago + ... + error
```
- Like saying "if it went up yesterday, it might go up today"

#### **📈 I (Integrated):** 
Makes the data **stationary** (removes trends).
```
Differenced_Price = Price_today - Price_yesterday
```
- Instead of using actual prices, use price **changes**

#### **📊 MA (Moving Average):**
Uses **past prediction errors** to improve forecasts.
```
Price_today = b₁×Error_yesterday + b₂×Error_2days_ago + ...
```
- Learns from past mistakes

### **🧮 ARIMA(p,d,q) Parameters:**

#### **p (AutoRegressive order):**
- How many **past prices** to use
- **p=1**: Use yesterday's price
- **p=2**: Use yesterday's and day-before's prices

#### **d (Differencing order):**
- How many times to **difference** the data
- **d=0**: Use original prices (if already stationary)
- **d=1**: Use price changes (most common)
- **d=2**: Use changes of changes (rarely needed)

#### **q (Moving Average order):**
- How many **past errors** to use
- **q=1**: Use yesterday's prediction error
- **q=2**: Use last 2 prediction errors

### **📊 Stationarity (CRITICAL Concept)**

#### **What is Stationarity?**
Data is **stationary** when:
- **Mean** doesn't change over time
- **Variance** doesn't change over time  
- No **trends** or **seasonal patterns**

#### **Why it matters:**
ARIMA **only works** on stationary data!

#### **Non-Stationary Example:**
```
Stock prices: $100 → $105 → $110 → $115 → $120
This has an upward trend = NOT stationary
```

#### **Stationary Example:**
```
Price changes: +$5 → +$5 → +$5 → +$5
This is stable = Stationary
```

### **🔬 Stationarity Tests:**

#### **ADF Test (Augmented Dickey-Fuller):**
- **Null Hypothesis**: Data is NOT stationary
- **p-value < 0.05**: Reject null = Data IS stationary ✅
- **p-value > 0.05**: Accept null = Data is NOT stationary ❌

#### **What our app shows:**
```
ADF Statistic: -3.456 (more negative = more stationary)
p-value: 0.032 (< 0.05 = stationary)
```

### **🎯 ARIMA Process in Our App:**

#### **Step 1: Load Data**
Get historical prices for selected stock

#### **Step 2: Test Stationarity**
Run ADF test on closing prices

#### **Step 3: Apply Differencing (if needed)**
```
If p-value > 0.05:
    Use price differences instead of prices
    Differenced_Data = Price[t] - Price[t-1]
```

#### **Step 4: Fit ARIMA(1,1,1)**
Our app uses simple parameters:
- **p=1**: Use 1 past value
- **d=1**: Apply differencing once  
- **q=1**: Use 1 past error

#### **Step 5: Make Predictions**
Forecast future price movements

#### **Step 6: Calculate Accuracy**
Compare predictions vs actual prices

### **🔮 How ARIMA Predictions Work:**

#### **If Data is Stationary (d=0):**
```
Predicted_Price = α×Yesterday_Price + β×Yesterday_Error + γ
```

#### **If Data Needs Differencing (d=1):**
```
Predicted_Change = α×Yesterday_Change + β×Yesterday_Error + γ
Predicted_Price = Today_Price + Predicted_Change
```

### **📊 ARIMA Strengths & Weaknesses:**

#### **✅ Strengths:**
- **Mathematical rigor**: Based on statistical theory
- **Good for trending data**: Handles trends well after differencing
- **Confidence intervals**: Provides uncertainty estimates
- **No overfitting**: Simple model with few parameters

#### **❌ Weaknesses:**
- **Linear only**: Can't capture complex patterns
- **Assumes patterns continue**: Past patterns must persist
- **Sensitive to outliers**: One bad day can throw off predictions
- **No external factors**: Ignores news, events, market conditions

## 🎯 **6. Performance Metrics (How Good Are Our Predictions?)**

### **📊 RMSE (Root Mean Square Error)**

#### **What it is:**
Measures the **average size** of prediction errors.

#### **Math Formula:**
```
RMSE = √[(Σ(Actual - Predicted)²) ÷ n]
```

#### **Example:**
```
Day 1: Actual=$100, Predicted=$102, Error=2
Day 2: Actual=$105, Predicted=$103, Error=2  
Day 3: Actual=$98,  Predicted=$101, Error=3

RMSE = √[(2² + 2² + 3²) ÷ 3] = √[17 ÷ 3] = √5.67 = $2.38
```

#### **What it means:**
- **Lower RMSE = Better predictions**
- **RMSE in dollars**: Easy to understand
- **Penalizes big errors more**: One huge mistake hurts more than many small ones

#### **For Trading:**
- **RMSE < $1**: Excellent predictions
- **RMSE $1-5**: Good predictions  
- **RMSE > $10**: Poor predictions

---

### **📈 MAE (Mean Absolute Error)**

#### **What it is:**
Average of **absolute errors** (ignore if positive/negative).

#### **Math Formula:**
```
MAE = Σ|Actual - Predicted| ÷ n
```

#### **Same Example:**
```
MAE = (|2| + |2| + |3|) ÷ 3 = 7 ÷ 3 = $2.33
```

#### **RMSE vs MAE:**
- **MAE treats all errors equally**
- **RMSE punishes big errors more**
- If **RMSE >> MAE**: We have some very bad predictions
- If **RMSE ≈ MAE**: Our errors are consistent

---

### **🎯 Accuracy Percentage**

#### **What it is:**
How close our predictions are as a percentage.

#### **Math Formula:**
```
MAPE = Mean Absolute Percentage Error
MAPE = Σ|((Actual - Predicted) ÷ Actual)| ÷ n × 100%

Accuracy = 100% - MAPE
```

#### **Example:**
```
Day 1: |($100-$102)/$100| = 2%
Day 2: |($105-$103)/$105| = 1.9%  
Day 3: |($98-$101)/$98| = 3.1%

MAPE = (2% + 1.9% + 3.1%) ÷ 3 = 2.33%
Accuracy = 100% - 2.33% = 97.67%
```

#### **Accuracy Scale:**
- **95%+**: Excellent model
- **85-95%**: Good model
- **70-85%**: Decent model  
- **<70%**: Poor model

---

### **📊 R² Score (Coefficient of Determination)**

#### **What it is:**
Measures how much of the **price variation** our model explains.

#### **Math Formula:**
```
R² = 1 - (SS_res ÷ SS_tot)

SS_res = Σ(Actual - Predicted)²     [Residual Sum of Squares]
SS_tot = Σ(Actual - Mean)²          [Total Sum of Squares]
```

#### **What it means:**
- **R² = 1.0**: Perfect predictions (explains 100% of variation)
- **R² = 0.5**: Explains 50% of price movements
- **R² = 0.0**: No better than guessing the average
- **R² < 0.0**: Worse than just guessing the average!

#### **For Trading:**
- **R² > 0.8**: Excellent model
- **R² 0.5-0.8**: Good model  
- **R² 0.2-0.5**: Weak model
- **R² < 0.2**: Useless model

#### **Real Example:**
```
If NVDA's price varies between $90-$130 (range=$40)
And our model predicts within ±$2 of actual prices
Then R² might be 0.95 (explains 95% of the variation)
```
